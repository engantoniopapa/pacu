Strange Deja Vu

Subconscious strange sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can`t wait to get there again

Every time I close my eyes
There`s another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

Closer now - Slowly coming into view
I`ve arrived - Blinding sunshine beaming through

There`s a house I`m drawn into
Familiar settings, nothing new
There`s a pathway leading there
With a haunting chill in the air

There`s room at the top of the stairs
Every night I`m drawn up there
There`s a girl in the mirror
Her face is getting clearer
Young child won`t you tell me why I`m here?

In her eyes -I sense a story never told
Behinde the disguise - There`s something tearing
At her soul

Pull Me Under

I get this feeling sometimes
Like theres nothing in the world that isn't mine
And I could have it all
Maybe I should have it all

I'll take you out of your life
Just the one sweet night
And you could take it all
Oh maybe I could rip it off

It's easy to pick and choose
With you and me we can only lose
Just don't fight me off
And I won't write you off

Take me in and then you push me out
Fall all over yourself tonight
And just don't let it go, without a fight
Take me in and then you push me out
Fall all over yourself tonight
And just don't let it go, let it go

So here I am again
Singing songs about the summer
Cause that's when you and me
When we came to be

I brought you home to my guitar
And told you how sweet you really are
Cause you know what's on my mind
Is you getting all this time

It's easy to pick and choose
With you and me we can only lose
Just don't find me out
And I won't fight you off

Take me in and then you push me out
Fall all over yourself tonight
And just don't let it go, let it go

Oh no no, another girl, no no
